Home Assistant Add-on & Docker Service

Automatically synchronise nursery activity logs from **Famly** into **Baby Connect**.  
This add-on uses Playwright browser automation to scrape events from Famly, normalise them, and recreate missing entries inside Baby Connect — all through an intuitive web dashboard built into Home Assistant.

> **Status:** Alpha — UI, selectors, and sync behaviour are still evolving.

## ⭐ Features

- Automated Famly → Baby Connect event sync  
- Headless Playwright scraping + Baby Connect form submission  
- Unified event model (meals, nappies/diapers, sleep, sign-in/out, etc.)  
- Detects missing entries and offers one-click “Sync All”  
- Home Assistant Ingress support — fully integrated UI  
- SQLite persistence under `/data` (events, credentials, mappings)  
- Built-in dashboard for:
  - Credential management (Famly + Baby Connect)
  - Event comparison (side-by-side)
  - Event mapping configuration
  - Manual sync and bulk sync actions
- Also available as a standalone Docker container  

## 📘 About API Access

This project uses **browser automation** because neither platform currently offers public APIs.

I have formally requested API access from both **Famly** and **Baby Connect**.  
Both companies responded confirming:

> **They do not offer public API access at this time, and may not provide it in the future.**

If official APIs ever become available, this project will migrate away from scraping.

## 📦 Installation (Home Assistant Add-on)

### Option A — Add Repository (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**
2. Click **⋮ → Repositories**
3. Add your GitHub repository URL
4. Locate **Famly → Baby Connect Sync**
5. Install → Start
6. Open the dashboard via the sidebar (Ingress)

### Option B — Manual installation

Place the add-on folder into:

```
/addons/famly_to_babyconnect_sync/
```

Then install via the HA Add-on Store.

## 🖥️ Accessing the UI (Ingress)

- Accessible from the **Home Assistant sidebar**
- No ports or networking config required
- Fully proxied & authenticated by Home Assistant
- All settings stored internally in `/data`

If the port is exposed externally, secure it behind authentication.

## 🔑 Credentials & Settings

All configuration is performed **within the UI**, not YAML.

You can configure:

- Famly email + password  
- Baby Connect email + password  
- Event mappings  
- Sync preferences  

Stored securely inside `/data/db.sqlite`.

## 🐳 Quick Start (Standalone Docker)

```
docker build -t famly-sync famly_to_babyconnect_sync

docker run   -p 8000:8000   -v "$(pwd)/data:/data"   famly-sync
```

Then open:  
`http://localhost:8000`
